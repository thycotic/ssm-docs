# Introduction to the Secret Server Mobile Application

The Secret Server Mobile Application allows IT Security Administrators in data centers to access login credentials from a mobile device. This also supports cached credentials for data centers that do not have any WiFi or cellular receptions options.

Employees that are typical end users or consumers of the Secret Server secrets can use the mobile application for quick access to business applications, corporate services, and tools from their mobile devices without the need to access their laptop or desktop systems.
