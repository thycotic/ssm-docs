# Offline Caching

Mobile devices and applications can lose internet connectivity for a number of reasons. When Secret Server Mobile loses internet connectivity, users cannot access their secrets directly from Secret Server. But an organization can permit its Secret Server Mobile users to save secrets and secret folders to an offline cache. Offline caching stores secrets, secret folders, and all of their associated data to a password-protected, encrypted data file. When a network connection to Secret Server is unavailable, users can access secrets and folders cached offline for a maximum Time-To-Live (TTL) period. TTL and access to offline caching are controlled by an organizationâ€™s Secret Server administrator globally, for all mobile devices in the organization. If an organization does not allow offline caching, the administrator sets the TTL to zero.

Accessing secrets saved to an offline cache requires using biometric face or fingerprint recognition. The offline cache is automatically updated by default, but a user can turn off the auto-update feature. The offline cache is automatically cleared when the user logs out of the application or switches to another user identity.
