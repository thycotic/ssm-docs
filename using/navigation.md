# Navigating the Mobile Application Interface

The Secret Server Mobile application interface has been designed to be similar to the Secret Server interface to make it easy for  users to search and browse through folders and secret collections to quickly find specific folders and secrets.

Users can then open, inspect, add, edit, or delete folders and secrets, mark them as Favorites, and designate them for availability offline.

The interface also makes functionality readily accessible, such as multi-factor authentication, biometric authentication, autofill, online and offline caching, and advanced secret workflows.

## Navigating the Application

After the user opens and logs into the mobile application, the Home screen appears.

### Home Screen

The Home screen offers several options enabling users to view secrets. The Search feature (magnifying glass icon) enables users to search for secrets by name. Four tabs on the Home page enable users to view their secrets four different ways:

* **All**: all secrets the user has view access to

* **Favorites**: secrets the user has designated as "Favorite"

* **Recent**: the 15 secrets accessed most recently by the user

* **Shared**: secrets shared between the user and other users

The Home screen displays a prominent Add icon ![add](images/add-icon.png "Add a Secret or Folder") near the bottom enabling users to quickly add folders and secrets. Secrets and folders on the Home screen and elsewhere display a vertical ellipses ![add](images/ellipses.png "Add a Secret or Folder") along one side.

Clicking an ellipses opens access to options that are generated dynamically, meaning that the options presented match the actions the user is likely to want to make at that moment. These actions can include view, delete, edit, cache, refresh cache, remove from cache, check in or check out, favorite or unfavorite, request access. etc.

### Side Navigation

In the top left corner of the Home screen is an icon composed of three horizontal lines stacked atop one another, sometimes in a straight stack and sometimes slightly askew. This icon is popularly known as a "hamburger." ![hamburger](images/hamburger2.png "Hamburger menu options") ![hamburger](images/scewburger.png "Hamburger menu options")
